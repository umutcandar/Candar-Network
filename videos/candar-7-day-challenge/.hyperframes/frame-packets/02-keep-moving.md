narrativeRole: Prove that the challenge lives inside a real, usable product rather than a vague promise.
keyMessage: Check in daily, protect the streak, and see the next step.

On-screen copy: “check in.” / “keep moving.”

Adapt: keep the held surface and cursorless static-tour signature; use one real Candar screen and animate a separate seven-step proof rail instead of inventing screen states.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.1s): ink-black field; the real daily-streak screen slides up and settles as the dominant portrait surface, rule-of-thirds with three depth layers, while “check in.” reveals above it on a smooth long-tail settle (`3d-page-scroll` for the framed surface establish).
Scene 2 (1.1–2.7s): seven gold progress ticks draw one by one around the held screen (`stat-bars-and-fills`); the sixth and seventh wait until the back half, while a compact “streak protected” status changes discretely (`discrete-text-sequence`). Camera remains locked.
Scene 3 (2.7–4.0s): “keep moving.” replaces the first line above the device; the seventh tick completes and the real product view holds fully readable. No breathing or drift; only one bounded gold shimmer may cross the completed rail.

# 3D Page Scroll

A webpage (or long content) presented as a tilted 3D card. Spring-eased scroll reveals specific sections while the static 3D perspective adds physical depth. (For a camera that actually travels/tilts, see [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md) — this rule's tilt never moves.)

## How It Works

Two independent transforms combine:

1. **3D tilt** — static `rotateY` + `rotateX` with `perspective` on the card. The angle does **not** change during the scene.
2. **Scroll** — the content inside the card translates vertically (`y` in GSAP) within a clipped container; spring-like deceleration via `power3.out` / `power4.out`.

Optional: **spotlight overlay** — a radial-gradient mask dims everything except a focal region after the scroll lands. It sits above the scrolling content, fixed relative to the card, never inside `.page-content`.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="tilt-card">
  <div class="page-content">
    <!-- Full {Brand} webpage recreation, taller than the card so scrolling
         matters. Each section is REAL DOM, not a screenshot — screenshots
         can't be individually highlighted or scrolled-to with precision. -->
    <section class="page-hero">{heroContents}</section>
    <section class="page-features">{featuresContents}</section>
    <section class="page-target" id="target-section">{targetContents}</section>
    <section class="page-cta">{ctaContents}</section>
  </div>
  <div class="spotlight"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.tilt-card {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  /* tilt + perspective in CSS only if no other transform tween touches this
     element — if GSAP also tweens scale on .tilt-card, set the tilt via
     gsap.set() instead to avoid matrix overwrites */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) perspective({perspectivePx}) rotateY({tiltYDeg}) rotateX({tiltXDeg});
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  width: {cardWidth};
  height: {cardHeight};
  border-radius: 24px;
  background: {cardBackgroundColor};
  overflow: hidden; /* clip the scrolling content at the rounded corners */
  /* shadow X-offset sign must match tiltY sign (negative tiltY ⇒ positive X) */
  box-shadow: 40px 30px 80px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
}
.page-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* height intrinsic from sections — taller than the card */
}
.spotlight {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0;
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse 60% 35% at 50% 50%, transparent 50%, {spotlightDimColor} 100%);
}
```

```js
// SCROLL_DISTANCE is measured at design time from the real page layout
// (top of .page-content origin to vertical center of #target-section,
// accounting for card height) — NOT a free tunable.
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT,
);

// Spotlight fades in on the target after the scroll settles.
tl.to(
  ".spotlight",
  { opacity: 1, duration: SPOTLIGHT_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.inOut" },
  SPOTLIGHT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

**Multi-step scroll (scroll → pause → scroll)** — multiple `y:` tweens at different positions. Distances are both measured from the `.page-content` origin (NOT delta from the previous step); GSAP composes successive `y:` tweens on the same property, each starting from the value the previous one left:

```js
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE_A, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT_A,
);
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE_B, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT_B,
);
// SCROLL_AT_A + SCROLL_DUR ≤ SCROLL_AT_B — the two scrolls must not fight for y
```

## Critical Constraints

- **Tilt is static** — the card holds its angle the whole scene.
- **Shadow direction matches tilt** — a left-leaning card casts shadow to the right (positive X offset); mismatch breaks the 3D illusion.
- **Page content is real HTML, not a screenshot**; scroll distances come from the real layout geometry.
- **`overflow: hidden` + `transform-style: preserve-3d` on `.tilt-card`** — clip at the rounded corners; preserve-3d for any 3D children / clean perspective composition.
- **Spotlight is an overlay above the scrolling content**, never inside `.page-content`.
- **Same easing across a multi-phase scroll**, and non-overlapping scroll windows.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

## Values

| token         | range       | notes                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bar count     | 4–6         | reads as "a trend" without clutter; the last bar is the current/accent value        |
| fill duration | 0.8–1.2s    | matched to the paired count-up so number and graphic land together (share the ease) |
| stagger       | 0.06–0.1s   | larger feels sluggish, 0 loses the build                                            |
| accent hue    | exactly one | bars/fill/stars all use the same accent, the rest is muted                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.
